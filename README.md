# Airbnb Clone Console
## Project Description

This project is an Airbnb clone that aims to replicate the functionality of the popular accommodation booking platform. The console application provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the Airbnb clone, allowing them to perform various actions related to property listings, bookings, and user management.

## Overview 
The AirBnB Clone Console is a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to manage AirBnB objects, such as users, states, cities, places, and more. With this console, you can perform various operations on these objects, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting them.

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the following actions can be performed:

    Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
    Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
    Performing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
    Updating attributes of an object
    Destroying an object
